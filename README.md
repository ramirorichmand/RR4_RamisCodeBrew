## 22/04/23 Mini-Project - Shop Landing Page

##  The Challenge

Your challenge is to **build out a shop landing page** which can be anything from a snacks or record shop to whatever excites you. You'll use the designs, code examples and what you've learned so far to guide you through the process‚Äîbut don't be afraid to google things along the way that you don't understand. Software development varies so much between languages and product versions so being able to find the information you are looking for efficiently, is an important skill.

## üéØ Project Aims

**Your users should be able to:**

- Build your webpage correctly for viewing within a fullscreen desktop window using HTML & CSS

   <br/>

<h2>ü§ì What I Learned</h2>
<p>Despite taking the time to think about how to build the different functionalities with clean and organized code, I came across some challenges, mainly related to the styling of the elements and responsiveness.</p>

<p>Using the SASS preprocessor helped me promote better readability within my code. Also, this was my first project with a Mobile First approach, which was essential to be able to adapt the layout and its functionalities to different devices.</p>
