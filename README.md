<h2>:computer: What I Learned</h2>
<p>Despite taking the time to think about how to build the different functionalities with clean and organized code, I came across some challenges, mainly related to the styling of the elements and responsiveness.</p>

<p>Using the SASS preprocessor helped me promote better readability within my code. Also, this was my first project with a Mobile First approach, which was essential to be able to adapt the layout and its functionalities to different devices.</p>
